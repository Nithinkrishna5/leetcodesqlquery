Write a solution to find the second highest distinct salary from the Employee table. If there is no second highest salary, return null (return None in Pandas).

Example 1:

Input: 
Employee table:
+----+--------+         
| id | salary |          
+----+--------+            
| 1  | 100    |          
| 2  | 200    |         
| 3  | 300    |
+----+--------+          

Example 2:

Input: 
Employee table:
+----+--------+
| id | salary |
+----+--------+
| 1  | 100    |
+----+--------+



Solution:- 

select (select distinct salary from employee order by salary desc limit 1 offset 1) as SecondHighestSalary;

Input 1
Output: 
+---------------------+
| SecondHighestSalary |
+---------------------+
| 200                 |
+---------------------+

input 2
Output: 
+---------------------+
| SecondHighestSalary |
+---------------------+
| null                |
+---------------------+
