Write a solution to find all customers who never order anything.

Return the result table in any order.

The result format is in the following example.

Example 1:
Input: 
Customers table:     Orders  table:
+----+-------+      +-----+-----------+
| id | name  |      | id  |customerId |
+----+-------+      +-----+-----------+
| 1  | Joe   |      | 1   | 3         |
| 2  | Henry |      | 2   | 1         |
| 3  | Sam   |      +-----+-----------+
| 4  | Max   |
+----+-------+



Solution :-

select name as Customers from Customer left join Orders on Customer.id=Orders.customersId where Orders.customerId s null;

or 

select name as Customers from Customers where not in( select orders.customerId from Orders);  

Output:- 

+-----------+
| Customers |
+-----------+
| Henry     |
| Max       |
+-----------+
